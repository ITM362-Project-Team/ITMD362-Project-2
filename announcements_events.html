            The goal of this World Congress is to promote dialogue concerning various crucial philosophical issues in todays world 
            and to explore the role of philosophy in our complicated times. The world we live in today faces many urgent issues that 
            require sustained and productive cross-cultural dialogue. The ideals of global peace and security remain elusive while a 
            sense of uncertainty pervades the dominant institutions of contemporary life. Traditional human values underlying our social 
            and political institutions are continually transformed by new developments in information technology, digitalization, 
            artificial intelligence, and the drive for economic efficiency. Although the globalization of trade and technology has 
            brought people together as never before, our differing outlooks, habits, and ideologies continue to separate us
          </p>
          <p>
            As philosophers, we must neither shut ourselves in ivory towers nor indulge ourselves with armchair philosophy. 
            We must face the issues that define our moment in history. Our times demand that we, as philosophers, work to foster 
            intellectual insight, imagination, social responsibility, and justice. Therefore, the International Society for Universal 
            Dialogue issues a call for papers and proposals for panels for the 12th World Congress of ISUD on the general theme of 
            “Philosophy in an Age of Crisis: Challenges and Prospects”, with the following sub-themes:

          <h1>XI 2016 World Congress</h2>
          <h2>VALUES AND IDEALS: THEORY AND PRAXIS</h2>
          <h3>Warsaw, Poland</h3>
          <h3>July 11-15, 2016</h3>
        <section class="congress-2018">
          <p>
              Congratulations on the successful XI ISUD World Congress hosted by the Polish Academy of Sciences, 
              the University of Warsaw, and the Philosophy for Dialogue Foundation!
          </p>
          <p>
              The 2016 XI ISUD World Congress was conducted as a celebration of the Societys founding 
              twenty-eight years ago in Warsaw. The Congress featured a geographically and culturally diverse group 
              of scholars representing 39 countries from North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Pacific Island nations. 
              Approximately 145 scholars attended and presented original research at the Congress.  A spirit of good will and eagerness 
              to engage in and cultivate inter-cultural philosophical dialogue pervaded the dynamics of the meeting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our deepest appreciation to the congress organizers, committee members whose hard work and contribution made the 2016 Congress 
            such a successful and productive event!
